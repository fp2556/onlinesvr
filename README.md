# OnlineSVR
Online Support Vector Machines for Regression



## About
This is my Master's Thesis. It was originally hosted on [onlinesvr.altervista.org](http://onlinesvr.altervista.org).
You can find more details about the algorithm and the implementation in the [papers](papers) section.



## Windows Interface Tool
![Windows Interface](/images/ScreenshotInterface.png)
Visual tool for training OnlineSVRs. The interface uses the C++ implementation of the code.



## Windows C++ Command Line Tool 
![Windows C++ Command Line](/images/ScreenshotConsole.jpg)

Command line tool for calling OnlineSVRs via command line. It could be plugged into third parties applications.



## Matlab Implementation

![Matlab Code](/images/ScreenshotMatlab.jpg)

Prototype useful for understanding how the algorithm works.
It is very slow, not recommend for practical applications.



## C++ Implementation
